MOTION

Motion is the change of position of a body with time. It occurs in solids, liquids and gases. <br>

TYPES OF MOTION<br>

1. RANDOM: It is the non-linear manner a body moves, changing direction continuously. Examples are dashing of feather in air and movement of molecules in gas. 

2. TRANSLATIONAL: It is the movement of a body from one point to another in a fixed direction. Examples are movement of a car from a point to another and movement of a man. 

3. ROTATIONAL: It is the movement of a body in a rotational manner about its axis. Examples are rotation of car wheels and earth. 

4. OSCILLATORY: It is the tro and fro movement about a fixed point. Examples are simple pendulum and punching a fixed bag. 

5. RELATIVE: It is the movement of an object in relation to another body. For instance, the movement of a car in relation to the trees. 

CAUSE OF MOTION

Force causes motion. Force is a vector quantity and measured in Newton (N)

TYPES OF FORCE

1. CONTACT: When the source of force is in contact with the object experiencing the force. Examples are push, pull, tension, friction etc. 

2. FIELD: Also called non-contact force. Here, the source of the force is not contact with the object. Examples are magnetic force, gravitational force and electric force. 

FRICTION

Friction is a type of contact force. It opposes the motion of two bodies sliding over another. It is higher in rough surfaces. It is a vector quantity that exists in solid, liquid and gas. 

LIMITING FRICTION acts between surfaces in contact. The reaction, R equals the weight of the object, mg

STATIC/STATIONARY FRICTION acts to prevent two surfaces from slipping. 

The coefficient of static friction,

μₛ = F/R = F/mg

When F = mgsin ∅
R = mgcos ∅

μₛ = mg sin ∅ / mg cos ∅ = tan ∅

DYNAMIC/SLIDING/KINETIC FRICTION exists between two surfaces in relative motion. 

Same formula as above. 

F × S = ½mv²

METHODS OF REDUCING FRICTION
1. Streamlining
2. Ball bearing
3. Lubricating
4. Polishing
