<h4> ECONOMICS</h4><br>
<h5>The basic concept or elements of economics are: <br>
Wants, <br>
Scarcity, <br>
Scale of preference, <br>
Choice and <br>
Opportunity cost.</h5>

<h4>WANTS</h4>

<h6>Wants simply means the desire or wish to own goods or services that give satisfaction. Goods include things such as cars, radios, food, houses, books, etc., (that is tangible commodities), while services incudes hair dressing, the services of an actor, etc(that is intangible commodities). Wants are also referred to as ENDS. They are usually insatiable because of the limited resources available.<br> Wants don't end. They are unlimited. </h6>

<h4>SCARCITY</h4>

Scarcity refers to the limited available resources used in satisfying the unlimited human wants.

These resources are scarce relative to their demand. It is as a result of scarcity of resources that needs the study of economics very essential in order to find alternative uses of these scarce resources. 

This problem makes us attend to the pressing needs. For instance, if you have #2000 and want to buy a charger worth #2000 and a sim card worth #1000. If the sim card is more important, you will purchase it and ignore the charger. 

Not that charger is not important to you but the sim card appears to be more important than the charger. 

SCALE OF PREFERENCE

Scale of preference refers to a list of unsatisfied wants arranged in order of their relative importance.

In other words, it is a list showing the order in which we want to satisfy our wants arrange in order of priority.

The drawing of scale of preference will  make it easier for choice to be made. In order to achieve maximum satisfaction with limited resources at their disposal, an individual, firm and unsatisfied wants in order of priority.

Each individual is assumed to have a scale of preference. This is because economics theory assumes that people always behave rationally and would satisfy their most pressing want first.

A scale of preference may not necessarily be a written list. It could be a mental list. For instance, you can act the example above without writing it.

IMPORTANCE OF SCALE OF PREFERENCE

Ranking of needs
Financial prudence
Identification of highest priority
Rational choice
Efficient utilisation of limited resources
Optimum allocation of resources
Maximisation of satisfaction

CHOICE

Choice can be defined as a system of selecting or choosing one out of a number of alternatives. Human wants  are many and we cannot satisfy all of them because of our limited resources.

We therefore, decide which of the wants we can satisfy first. Choice arises as a result of numerous human wants and the scarcity of the resources used in satisfying these wants.

OPPORTUNITY COST

Opportunity cost is also known as a real cost or time cost.

The concept of opportunity cost is used in economics to express cost in terms of foregone or sacrificed alternatives. Opportunity cost means the alternative foregone or sacrifice made in  order to satisfy another want. It is the satisfaction of one’s want at the expense of another want.

The opportunity cost of the sim card bought is the charger. It was sacrificed for the charger. The money cost however is #1000. 

BASIC ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF SOCIETY

In every economic system, what to produce, how to produce, for when to produce and efficiency of the resources used or efficient use of resources are major problems. These problems are peculiar to every system be it socialism (where government determines the market), capitalism (where price determines the market) or mixed economy (combination of both).

WHAT TO PRODUCE

Firms, households, and the government are faced with the problem of deciding on the types of goods and services to produce for society. This problem arises mainly as a result of the fact that human wants are unlimited relative to the available resources.

It is practically impossible to produce all human wants or needs hence; there is a need for resources allocation in order to meet the pressing needs of the people

FACTORS WHICH DETERMINE WHAT TO PRODUCE

Consumers’ need
Marker demand
Consumer Income
Cost of production
Types of economy

HOW TO PRODUCE

Producers have to decide on the technique of production. The decision to produce importees determining the resources to be used those to produce these commodities and the production techniques or methods to be used.

Two main methods of production are Labour intensive and capital intensives, can be adopted.

Labour – intensives method implies the use of more labour and little capital which capital intensive method uses more capital like machines and less labour. Africa is a labour extensive market. 

FOR WHOM TO PRODUCE

The next basic economic problem is the determination of who will enjoy the goods and services produced.

Irrespective of the type of economic system adopted, goods and services are produced many to satisfy human wants.

EFFICIENCY OF RESOURCE USED

Efficiency of resources used in production refers to the optimum use or combination of factors of production to achieve higher and better output at a reasonable cost.

BASIC ECONOMICS TOOLS

To analyse economic problems, we need some basic tools which are:

1. TABLE
It is an orderly arrangements of data using rows and columns. It is very easy to construct and understand and the title, source, units of measurement should be stated. 

2. GRAPH
Graph is a diagram that shows the functional relationship between two variables. It must have a title, appropriate scales, units of measurement and source of data. 

TYPES OF GRAPH
LINE GRAPH: The use of lines to show continuous change. Lines could be straight or curved. 

PIE CHART/GRAPH: The use of sectors of a circle to show the value of the quantities. As the whole circle is 360°, a quantity of 100 with the sum total as 300 will give a sectorial angle of 120° (100/300 × 360° = 120°). 

BAR CHART/GRAPH: This involves the use of bars of rectangles whose lengths show the the proportion of quantities they represent. Bar chart could be simple (a normal one), component (top bar and bottom bar showing different quantities) or multiple (different bars line side by side). 

PICTOGRAM: Also called pictograph, this involves the use of pictures or drawings to represent items in a given data. 

HISTOGRAM: A graphical representation of a set of rectangles joined together. This is the key difference between a histogram and a bar chart (where there's a space between the bars). 

MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY

ARITHMETIC MEAN
Also called mean, it is the summation of the figures divided by the number of the figures. 
X̅ = Σx/n = Σfx/Σf
Σ means summation. 

HARMONIC MEAN
It is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean (average) of the reciprocal of the given numbers. 

For instance, what is the harmonic mean of 4,6 and 8?

SOLUTION
H = ⅓(¼+⅙+⅛) = ⅓ (13/24) = 13/72
∴ H = 72/13 = 5.5 

GEOMETRIC MEAN
It is the Nth root of the product of the numbers. 

For example, the geometric mean of 6, 8 and 12 is

SOLUTION
N = 3
G = 3√ 6 × 8 × 12
G = 3√ 576 = 8.32

QUADRATIC MEAN
It is the square root of the arithmetic mean of their squares. 

Another example is finding the quadratic mean of 2,4,6 and 8. 

SOLUTION
R.M.S (root mean square)
= √2² + 4² + 6² + 8²/4
= √120/4 = √30 = 5.4

<h4>MEDIAN</h4>
The middle value of the figures when arranged in order of magnitude. 

When n is odd, the median lies in the (n+1/ 2)th position. The following set of numbers: 2,3,3,4,9 has the median in the 3rd position (5+1/ 2 = 6/2 = 3rd). So, the median is 3. 

When the number is even, same method applies. For instance, the median of 5,6,7,10,12,22 is in the 3rd and 4th position (6+1/ 2 = 7/2 = 3.5 ≈ 3rd and 4th). So, the median is 7+10/2 = 17/2 = 8.5)

<h4>MODE</h4>
<h6>It is the most frequently occurring number in a set of data. When a set of values have two modes, it is said to be bimodal. But when it has more, it is multi-modal. A single mode will then be uni-modal. </h6>
