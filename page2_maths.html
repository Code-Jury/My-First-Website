 Topic:Indices

What are indices?

     Indices are numbers in powers.if a real number "a" is multiplied by any number of times,the number of times of the multiplication is called the power of "a"or the index of "a".

Example:a×a×a×a=a^4

This means that four is the power or index of a. The analysis or simplification depends on the basic interpretations and rules of indices.

        Basic interpretations.

1. Numbers with zero(0) powers: This is taken as Examples;A^0=1, 10^0=1 .

2. Numbers with a negative powers :This is taken as the reciprocal of the result remaining when the negative sign is removed.
Examples;a^-1=1/(a)^1, 2^-3=1/(2)^3=1/2×1/2×1/2=1/8.
 
   Another name for reciprocal is inverse.

3. Numbers with fractional powers :This is simplified by taking the denominator of the fraction as the root and the numerator as the power of the result.
Examples;a^b/c=8^2/3=(3√8)^2=the cube root of 8=2
i.e 2×2=4.

4. Numbers with negative fractional power: This is simplified by combining the second and third rules above.
Examples;a^-b/c=(1/√a)^b or 27^-2/3 or 27^-2/3=1/(3√27)^2
=1/(3)^2=1/3×3=1/9.

   
            Laws of indices.
1.  Product/multiplication law:This law states that if the basis of a given indices are the same,add the powers. Example;a^3×a^2=a^3+2=a^5. 

 2.  Division law:This law states that if the basis of a given indices are the same,subtract the powers.
Example;a^x÷a^y=a^x_y or  5^4÷5^2=5^4_2=5^2.

3.  Power law:This law states that when a number that is raised to a certain power is again raised to another power,the two powers are multiplied.
 Example;(a^b)^c=a^bc or (2^3)^2=2^3×2=2^6=64.
   
   Working Examples.
1. Simplify (81/16)^3/4
                solution
   4(81/16)^3 or (4√81/16)^3
N:B The above shows what number or you think of a number that when you multiply itself four times, will give you their bases.
=(3/2)^3
=3×3×3/2×2×2
=27/8.
    
2. Simplify (81/25)^-1/2
                solution.
1/(√81/25)^1
=1/(9/5)^1
  1/9/5
1÷9/5
1×5/9
=5/9.

3. (100/36)^-3/2
       solution
1/(√100/36)^3
1/(10/6)^3
1/10×10×10/6×6×6
1/1000/216
1÷1000/216
1×216/1000
216/1000
=27/125.
     
         Working Examples.
1. Solve 1/81^(x-2)=27^(1-x)
81^-(x-2)=27^(1-x)
3^4×-(x-2)=3^3(1-x)
3^-4(x-2)=3^3(1-x)
Expand we have;
3^-4x+8=3^3-3x
Bases of both side(3) cancel themselves,we have;
-4x+8=3-3x
Collect like terms.
-4x+3x=3-8
-x=-5
Divide both side by the coefficient of x(-1)
-x/-1=-5/-1
x=-5/-1
x=5.

2.9^2x-1/27^x+1=1/9
3^2(2x-1)/3^3(x+1)=9^-1
3^2(2x-1)/3^3(x+1)=3^2(-1)
3^4x-2/3^3x+3=3^-2
3^4x-2-(3x+3)=3^-2
3^4x-2-3x-3=3^-2
Bases of both sides cancel each other.
4x-2-3x-3=-2
4x-3x-2-3=-2
x-5=-2
Collect like terms
x=-2+5
x=3.
