BIOLOGY

Biology is derived from two Greek words, "bio" meaning "life" and "logy" meaning "studying of life." Biology is then defined as the scientific study of life, that is, the study of plants and animals. 

There are two major branches of Biology which are:

1. Botany: The study of plants.
2. Zoology: The study of animals. 

Other branches of Biology are:

1.  Microbiology
2. Biochemistry
3. Biomedical science
4. Physiology
5. Marine biology
6. Genetics
7. Ecology
8. Anatomy
9. Biophysics
10. Biotechnology
11. Cell Biology
12. Immunology etc. 

SCIENTIFIC PROCESSES

1. OBSERVATION: As a student of biology, you must learn to observe changes around you. 

2. HYPOTHESIS: Then, you can give a tentative statement explaining your observations. For instance, you can say that air makes an object light after observing a balloon float on water. 

3. EXPERIMENTS: As Galileo Galilei has shown, we don't speak facts. We show facts. Now, you get two objects and fill one with air and the other with water. The object filled with water is called the control group. It's meant to counter the hypothesis. 

4. THEORY: So at the end of the day, you conclude that air makes an object float after your experiments. Your conclusion is called a theory. A theory is an acceptable statement for an action after series of successful experiments. 

5. LAW: When a theory is applied in wide areas, it will become a law. We cannot actually call your theory of floatation a law because there's a law of floatation by Archimedes that gives a better reason why things float. 

<h4>CLASSIFICATION OF LIVING THINGS</h4>

<h4><b>VIRUSES</b>: <h6>They are very small that they can only be seen through the more powerful electron microscope. They behave like non-living things (crystals) outside the cell and living things within the cell. They are the major causes of the deadliest plant and animal diseases.</h6>

KINGDOM MONERA: They include the simplest living organisms: bacteria and more ancient blue-green algae. They have prokaryotic cells (cells without a defined nuclues). 

BACTERIA can be seen with a light microscope. They occur singly, in groups or in chains. They produce energy from simple inorganic compounds and reproduce very fast through binary fission (A parent cell divides into binary or two daughter cells). Some motile bacteria possess a flagellum (a whip-like structure). 

BLUE-GREEN ALGA also called CYANOBACTERIA contain chlorophyll and can produce their own food. They are found mainly in freshwater and in damp places on land. So, you might have come across them. They exist as single cells or as colonies. Examples are Nostoc and Oscillatoria.

RECOGNIZING OF LIVING THINGS (part II)

Living things includes - Plant and animals  e. g man, rat, Rabbit, dog , mango tree. etc

Non living things includes - air, stone, water etc

Characteristics of living things

★Movement - Ability of an organism to move its own body from places. Animals moves while plants parts response to external stimuli.

★ Nutrition - Ability of living organism to feed. Green plants manufacture their own through the photosynthesis process ( Autotrophic or holophytic nutrition) While animals does not but depends on plant directly or indirectly ( heterotrophic or holozoic nutrition)

★ Respiration - Exchange of gases between organisms and their environment ( oxygen and carbon dioxide respectively) to release energy for work.

★ Excretion - removal of metabolic waste product in the body e.g Carbon dioxide and water which might be toxic to the body.

★Irritability or sensitivity - Response to stimuli e.g light, pain, water, sound and chemical substance.

★Growth - Irreversible increase in size, dry Mass or weight of an organism due to addition of proton plasmic material.

★Reproduction - To reproduce young ones or offspring. it occurs in two  forms

a. Asexual reproduction- Involving only one organism to produce another offspring.

b. Sexual reproduction- Involving two organism coming together for reproduction purposes.

★Adaptation - Getting used to an environment in a manner that they would be comfortable.

★ Life span/ death - Having a definite limited period of existence. e.g Birth - Growth - maturity - Decline ( old age) - death.

★ Competition - Organism tends to struggle for survival in their various environment e.g food, light, space etc.
